# Woody-Costume-Parts
Designs for the 3D printed parts of Woody's costume

## Rendering
The `render` branch is exclusively for updating renders of the designs.
To contribute a render, merge the main branch into the render branch with the --no-ff option,
then stage your render and commit it with the --amend option, adding a commit message at this time.

This ensures that main does not contain an older render alongside new CAD files by keeping renders in a separate branch.
